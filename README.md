**SIMON GAME:**

_How to play:-_

Start game by clicking a key/tapping on the blue space(and not the buttons if playing on mobile)
After one of the four buttons flashes-click/press that button
Then another will flash after which you have to click/press the buttons in the order from when the game started.

**REMINDER: When playing make sure to first wait for the screen to indicate that you have pressed the button and only then proceed to clicking the next button in sequence,otherwise it will result to an incorrect sequence and that game will end**

For instance,
  if the first button that flashes was red,then click/press red
  lets suppose after that the yellow button flashes,then you would have to click/press red first and then yellow and so on for the next levels.
  
Progress to new levels as you get the pattern right!!!
